## The Story
In this world, Allasia, an evil tyrant by the name of Lord Ardradd rules the southern part of the continent. He has made an army to take over You Majesties land (which is to the North). Today Your Majesty calls you into his throne room and says, “Go to the Evil Castle and kill Lord Ardradd!” You accept and get ready to leave the castle on the peril quest ahead.

## Aside
The first game I ever created on back in January 1991  using QuickBasic 4.5. Back then I had an XT computer (Intel 8086 CPU no FPU) with 1024 Bytes of RAM, 30 MB hard drive and monochrome monitor running DOS 3.2.
